# StopWatch-Using-PIC


Implementation Of Stop Watch using PIC18F452 and Seven Segment Display Using Seven Segment Display and hardware interrupts of PIC18F452 .This stop watch runs from 0 to 9 then again starts from 0.

Three hardware interrupts are used in this project namely INT0 ,INT1 and INT2 . INT0 is the reset button, INT1 is the pause button and INT2 is the resume button.


Note:- The circuit diagram given here doesn't contain the ground for PIC,In actual design ground the VSS
